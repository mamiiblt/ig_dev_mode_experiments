# What are developer options?

Developer options is a page that Instagram's developers have added to the app. Here you can change, edit or add features related to Instagram.

## How can I access these developer options?

There is currently no way for iOS, but you can access these options using Moded Instagram apps for Android (e.g. MyInsta, Instander, AeroInsta)

::alert{type="warning"}
The features in the developer options include features that are being tested by Instagram and are in unstable development. Since these options are not yet stable, they may cause the app to crash on some devices.
